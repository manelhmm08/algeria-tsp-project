Algeria TSP – Metaheuristics (Random, Local Search, SA, GA)

This project solves a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instance on major Algerian cities using several metaheuristics. It implements and compares:

Random search
Local search / 2‑opt
Hill climbing
Simulated annealing
Genetic algorithm with crossover and mutation operators

Routes are represented as permutations of city indices (start/end at Algiers), and each algorithm reports the best route found and its total distance, allowing a clear comparison of solution quality and behavior between methods.
